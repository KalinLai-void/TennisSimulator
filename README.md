# TennisSimulator
## Intro
The tennis trajectory simulation developed by TrackNet allows users to visualize the ball's flight after a shot. It supports both forehand and backhand strokes, providing information such as the ballâ€™s trajectory, launch angle, and initial speed. However, one limitation is that the racket or hand movements may occasionally obscure the ball during hitting, leading to potential tracking errors.
